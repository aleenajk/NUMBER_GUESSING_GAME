#  Number Guessing Game  

##  Project Overview  
This is a simple **Python-based Number Guessing Game** where the computer randomly selects a number between **0 and 100**, and the player has to guess it.  
The game provides **hints** to guide the player:  
-  Whether the guess is **higher** or **lower** than the secret number  
-  Proximity hints like *Super Close, Close, Warm, Far Away*  

Itâ€™s a fun beginner-friendly project to practice:  
- Loops (`while`)  
- Conditionals (`if-elif-else`)  
- Random number generation (`numpy.random`)  
- User interaction with input/output

##  How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aleenajk/NUMBER_GUESSING_GAME.git

##  Tech Stack  
- **Python 3**  
- **NumPy** (for random number generation)

## Future Improvements  
- Add a **limited number of attempts**  
- Implement a **score system**  
- Add **difficulty levels** (Easy/Medium/Hard)  
- GUI version using **Tkinter** or **PyQt**
